# AI Agents for Order and Chaos

This project implements AI agents to play the game of **'Order and Chaos'**, a tic-tac-toe variant. The agents use the **alpha-beta search algorithm** to make optimal moves.

The game's front end is built with **PixiJS** for graphics rendering and **TypeScript** for robust development.
